    <h1>The Fox’s Anvil · Open Resilience Tools</h1>

    <p>
      The Fox’s Anvil is a commons-based workshop for tools that meet the world
      at the scale of land, water, and community. These are not wearables or toys.
      They are open designs for real work: restoration, flood and fire response,
      agroecology, and community resilience.
    </p>

    <p>
      All designs shared here are part of an open hardware commons. They are meant
      to be built, repaired, adapted, and improved by farmers, welders, mechanics,
      neighbors, students, and volunteers—anyone willing to take responsibility
      for their use.
    </p>

    <h2>Relation to MythWear</h2>
    <p>
      MythWear Commons focuses on body-scale tools, garments, and movement companions.
      The Fox’s Anvil focuses on land-scale and infrastructure-scale tools.
      They are siblings: one close to the skin, one close to the ground.
