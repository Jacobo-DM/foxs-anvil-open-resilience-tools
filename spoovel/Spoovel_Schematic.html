      <h2>Functional Brief</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The Spoovel Mechanism is a low-tech, modular tool intended to make the repeated task of
        filling, closing, and deploying sacks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Faster and more consistent than fully manual methods.</li>
        <li>Less physically punishing for workers and volunteers.</li>
        <li>Less dependent on diesel-heavy equipment and fragile supply chains.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Typical use-cases include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flood response and temporary levee construction.</li>
        <li>Erosion control and slope stabilization.</li>
        <li>Soil and compost movement for restoration projects.</li>
        <li>Seed, biochar, or amendment mixes for agroecology.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Scale & Modularity</h3>
      <p>
        The core Spoovel unit is designed for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Two–four human operators working in rotation.</li>
        <li>Portable deployment in the back of a truck, on a trailer, or on-site frames.</li>
        <li>Construction from common steel profiles, bicycle parts, and scrap components.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Additional modules (such as a Commons Conveyor, sorting screens, or a MedicineWheel data interface)
        can be bolted on without redesigning the core mechanism.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Key Design Principles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low-tech / high-resilience:</strong> Prefer gravity, levers, cams, and pedals over electronics.</li>
        <li><strong>Field-repairable:</strong> All wear points accessible; replacement parts sourceable locally.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeatable cycle:</strong> A clear, repeatable motion that workers can learn quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Ergonomic:</strong> Reduce awkward bending, twisting, and lifting where possible.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <div class="section-label">Section 3</div>
      <h2>Mechanism Overview</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Major Subsystems</h3>
      <p>The Spoovel Mechanism can be understood as four primary subsystems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frame & Sack Station:</strong> Fixed structure holding sacks at working height.</li>
        <li><strong>Material Intake & Drop:</strong> Where soil or material is guided into the sack mouth.</li>
        <li><strong>Cycling Arm / Cam System:</strong> Converts human input (pedal, handle, or crank) into a regular cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Closure & Release:</strong> How the sack is twisted, tied, or otherwise sealed and released.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.2 Frame & Sack Station</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Built from steel angle, tube, or repurposed rack material.</li>
        <li>Front station features hooks or clamps to hold sack tops open.</li>
        <li>Height chosen so operators can stand upright with minimal forward bend.</li>
        <li>Optional footplate or platform for worker stability and leveling on rough ground.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.3 Material Intake</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A funnel or chute guides material from shovels, small loaders, or conveyors.</li>
        <li>Chute mouth is wide enough for two shovelers to work without clashing.</li>
        <li>Chute exit is positioned just above the open sack mouth.</li>
        <li>Optional “spoiler” plates inside the chute diffuse impact and reduce sack tearing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.4 Cycling Arm / Cam</h3>
      <p>
        A simple cam wheel, crank, or rocking beam governs the rhythm of the machine. Human input can be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Foot pedal (treadle-style).</li>
        <li>Hand lever or crank.</li>
        <li>Tandem arrangement where one operator pedals while others shovel and handle sacks.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The cam does <em>not</em> move the soil; it moves the work around the sack: clamping, shaking, twisting, and releasing.
      </p>

      <h3>3.5 Closure & Release</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A pair of opposed arms or grippers hold the top of the sack and twist or fold it as the cam cycles.
        </li>
        <li>
          A simple tie or clip mechanism (wire, cord, or strap) is engaged at the end of the twist.
        </li>
        <li>
          The cam then opens the grippers and allows the sealed sack to drop to a waiting pallet or slide.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Functional Cycle (One Example)</h2>

      <p>
        This section describes a possible full cycle for one Spoovel unit. Actual implementations may vary.
      </p>

      <pre>
1. PREPARE
   - Empty sack is placed on hooks/clamps at the front station.
   - Operator checks that chute is clear and pallet/slide is in position.

2. FILL
   - One or two workers shovel material into the intake chute.
   - Material drops through the chute into the sack.
   - A gentle shake, governed by the cam or a foot tap, helps settle material.

3. LEVEL / CHECK
   - Operator visually checks approximate fill level (by line, weight feel, or simple gauge).
   - If under-filled, additional shovels are added; if overfilled, excess is removed.

4. CLOSE
   - Operator gathers the top of the sack and places it into the closure arms.
   - With a single pedal/lever stroke, the cam engages:
       - Arms twist, fold, or pinch the sack top into a consistent closure shape.

5. TIE / SECURE
   - Tie material (wire, cord, strap) is looped and cinched around the twisted/closed section.
   - This can be manual or assisted by a simple tie guide on the frame.

6. RELEASE
   - Cam completes its cycle and opens the arms.
   - Sack drops to pallet/slide.
   - Operator clears station and hangs the next empty sack.

7. RESET
   - Pedal/lever returns to neutral.
   - Frame and chute are visually checked before repeating the cycle.

      <h2>Materials & Build Notes (High-Level)</h2>

      <p>
        The Spoovel Mechanism is intentionally specified at a high level so that local builders can
        adapt to available materials.
      </p>

      <h3>5.1 Typical Material Sources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Scrap steel angle, tube, or channel for the frame.</li>
        <li>Old bicycle frames, cranks, or hubs for cam and pedal assemblies.</li>
        <li>Reclaimed conveyor or chute pieces for the material intake.</li>
        <li>Springs, hinges, or clamps from agricultural or workshop scrap bins.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.2 Tools Required (Minimum)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Welder (MIG or stick) or strong bolted construction methods.</li>
        <li>Angle grinder or hacksaw for cutting steel.</li>
        <li>Drill and bits for pivot points and bolt holes.</li>
        <li>Measuring tools, square, and basic layout tools.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.3 Safety Considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>All moving parts should have guards where pinch or crush hazards exist.</li>
        <li>Operators should be trained in the cycle and shown safe zones around the frame.</li>
        <li>Emergency stop: a simple way to disengage or block the cam in case of trouble.</li>
        <li>Regular inspection of welds, pivots, and hooks for fatigue and cracking.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <hr />

    <section id="adaptation">
      <div class="section-label">Section 6</div>
      <h2>Adaptation & Field Notes</h2>

      <p>
        Builders and field crews are encouraged to treat this schematic as a starting point, not a rigid blueprint.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Record what works well and what fails under real conditions.</li>
        <li>Photograph and sketch modifications; share them back to the Commons.</li>
        <li>Adapt the frame height and stance for local body sizes and terrain.</li>
        <li>Explore modular mounts: truck bed, trailer, ground frame, barge, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A MedicineWheel-style knowledge sharing system may be used to gather versions of the Spoovel
        from many regions, climates, and communities. The goal is not a single “perfect” design but a
        network of related, interoperable tools tuned to local realities.
